# Predicting-Tennis-Matches-Live-Betting-

In this project, we will attempt to build a model which is able to predict the odds of success of a bet, at any point in a tennis game. Currently, the best published models in tennis match prediction have accuracies hovering around 64%. We will attempt to obtain a similar or better performance. A dataset containing the in-game statistics of over 1400 US Open, Australia Open, French Open and Wimbledon Open Tennis Competitions has been downloaded from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tennis+Major+Tournament+Match+Statistics) and processed for the study. The performance of different classification techniques, such as Support Vector Classifiers, Logit Regression and Decision Tree classifiers, will be evaluated and compared.
